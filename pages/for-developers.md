You are in a starting point for learning how to:
- [write Web apps]({{site.baseUrl}}/for-developers/apps) so that users can make most of their data
- [become a Pod provider]({{site.baseUrl}}/for-developers/pod-server) to help users store their data, or [self-host your Pod](/for-developers/pod-server)
- become an identity provider to help users connect with each other or login to Web apps and Pods (available soon)

If you're not sure which one of thoses paths is right for you, and just want to start playing with Solid try to [develop your first Web app]({{site.baseUrl}}/for-developers/apps/first-app). Alternatively, you can [read more about Solid]({{site.baseUrl}}/#what-is-solid) or search the [FAQs]({{site.baseUrl}}/faqs). 

Once you are familiar with Solid, you can check out the [job board](job-board).
