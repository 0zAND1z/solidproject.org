# 21st November 2019

Hello and welcome to another edition of *This Week in Solid*!

If you are familiar with this newsletter you can [skip directly to updates](##updates).

[Solid](https://solidproject.org) is a standard that describes how to build data storage and applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.

This is a weekly summary of Solid progress.

Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at info@solidproject.org. This Week in Solid is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/blob/master/_posts/this-week-in-solid/next.md). If you find any errors in this week's issue please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/pulls).

## Updates

### Weekly Solid Call

Every Thursday there is an hour long public call where newcomers can introduce themselves, anyone can ask general questions about Solid, and we recap the weeks works on Solid. 

Tune in on the 21st November at 1400 [this line](https://zoom.us/j/261297657).

This week we will be trying something new. The current profile of the people developing the Solid standards is very homogenous both in profession and perspective meaning we may be blind to certain key considerations. 

If we could make the standard as generic and applicable both geographically and through changing opinions over time that would be fantastic. For example, having data interoperability of medical records across continents would be very valuable both for epidemiology, drug development, and smooth healthcare services for individuals travelling across borders.

The idea of the call on the 21st is to invite people who are potentially interested in specification development as well as those who are heavily engaged in the specification development today. That way the people currently developing can present on the latest and invite questions. It would also be very good for those developing the Solid standard to be able to ask questions to those curious in joining to understand how to make that possible.

There’s no commitment in joining this call beyond joining this call. Just hearing your thoughts on how to cast the net wider would be valuable in itself.

Please feel free to invite others.
