If you're here, it means that there are portions of your application that are covered by no existing vocabulary. If this is the case, you'll need to __build your own vocabulary__. Before getting started, let us remind you that the more existing vocabularies you reuse, the more reusable data from your app will re reusable by others. Therefore, a good thing to keep in mind is that your vocabulary should really be focused on a specific domain that you want to be able to describe, and for which nothing else exists. To make things more hands-on, we'll build an overly simplified webcomic vocabulary as a toy example.
