# 14th November

Hello and welcome to another edition of *This Week in Solid*!

If you are familiar with this newsletter you can [skip directly to updates](##updates).

[Solid](https://solidproject.org) is a standard that describes how to build data storage and applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.

This is a weekly summary of Solid progress.
