## Getting Started with Solid
To get started with Solid you will first need a Pod and a WebID, after which you can start [using Solid apps]({{site.baseUrl}}/use-solid/apps). 

# Get a Pod with a WebID
Pods are where you store your data. 

The way to get most control of your data is to [self-host](/for-developers/pod-server). You can also choose to outsource the work and get a Pod provider. Pick a Pod provider here:

If you are a Pod provider you can add your service to this list (direct to a way to add identity provider info).
