Let us build a very simple vocabulary describing [obelisks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk), so that [Cleopatra](https://cleopatra.solid.community/profile/card#me) and [Caesar](https://jcaesar.solid.community/profile/card#me) can share information about their personal collections.

## From plain English to a graphical representation

Let's start by stating in English what we want to put in our vocabulary:
- An <u>obelisk</u> is <u>owned by</u> a <u>person</u>.
- An <u>obelisk</u> is <u>built by</u> a <u>sculptor</u>.
- An <u>obelisk</u> has a <u>height</u>, which is a numerical value.

The underlined elements of these sentences are going to be the terms of our vocabulary. We can identify two types of terms: the things that we talk about (e.g. <u>obelisk</u>), and their properties (e.g. <u>built by</u>). Let's make a graphical representation of that, by putting the things in bubbles and the properties in squares:

## From the representation to RDF

### Identifying things with IRI

RDF is the language that is used to build vocabularies for Linked Data. In RDF, everything is identified by an IRI. First, we'll need an IRI for our vocabulary, e.g. http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/. From there, let's update our plain English example a little bit:
- An <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Obelisk</u> is <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/ownedBy</u> a <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Person</u>.
- An <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Obelisk</u> is <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/builtBy</u> a <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Sculptor</u>.
- An <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Obelisk</u> has a <u>http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/height</u>, which is a numerical value.

Identifiers are getting unpleasant to read very fast when they are IRI, so RDF introduces the notion of prefix: from now on, `obelisk:` will stand for `http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/`, which means our vocabulary now looks like:
- An <u>obelisk:Obelisk</u> is <u>obelisk:ownedBy</u> a <u>obelisk:Person</u>.
- An <u>obelisk:Obelisk</u> is <u>obelisk:builtBy</u> a <u>obelisk:Sculptor</u>.
- An <u>obelisk:Obelisk</u> has a <u>obelisk:height</u>, which is a numerical value.

### Defining classes of things

In RDF, the general things that we can talk about are called __classes__. Everything that went in a bubble in our first schema is therefore a class, so we could add to our vocabulary:
- <u>obelisk:Obelisk</u> is a class.
- <u>obelisk:Person</u> is a class.
- <u>obelisk:Sculptor</u> is a class.

If we look at these sentences, they are structured exactly like the ones from the rest of the vocabulary. Let us underline the important bits in the same way:
- <u>obelisk:Obelisk</u> <u>is a</u> <u>class</u>.
- <u>obelisk:Person</u> <u>is a</u> <u>class</u>.
- <u>obelisk:Sculptor</u> <u>is a<u> <u>class</u>.

What we need now are IRI for the "<u>is a</u>" property and the "<u>class</u>" class. Fortunately, these are defined in the RDF and RDFS vocabularies: "<u>is a</u>" is defined by [rdf:type](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type), and "<u>class</u>" by [rdfs:Class](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class). Therefore, we could write:

```
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

obelisk:Obelisk rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Person rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Sculptor rdf:type rdfs:Class .
```

And congratulation, you just read your first snippet of RDF! This RDF syntax is called the Turtle syntax, other exist but we don't need to go over them in this tutorial.

### Defining properties

The properties of things in RDF are called properties (how convenient). Therefore, following what we did for classes, we might write:
- <u>obelisk:ownedBy</u> <u>is a</u> <u>property</u>.
- <u>obelisk:builtBy</u> <u>is a</u> <u>property</u>.
- <u>obelisk:height</u> <u>is a</u> <u>property</u>.

We already know that <u>is a</u> is identified by the IRI [rdf:type](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type), so we can go ahead and change that into:
- <u>obelisk:ownedBy</u> <u>rdf:type</u> <u>property</u>.
- <u>obelisk:builtBy</u> <u>rdf:type</u> <u>property</u>.
- <u>obelisk:height</u> <u>rdf:type</u> <u>property</u>.

However, we can see on the graphical representation we made earlier that there are two kind of properties: the one connecting things (bubbles) together, and the ones attaching a value to a thing. These are actually two different classes of properties: the former are called [owl:ObjectProperty](http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#ObjectProperty), and the latter [owl:DataProperty](http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#DataProperty).

Which leads to our vocabulary looking like this:

```
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .

obelisk:Obelisk rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Person rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Sculptor rdf:type rdfs:Class .

obelisk:ownedBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
obelisk:builtBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
obelisk:height rdf:type owl:DataProperty .
```

However, we can see in this current vocabulary that some information is missing compared to our initial schema: nowhere does it say that `obelisk:ownedBy` has something to do with `obelisk:Obelisk` and `obelisk:Person` for instance. To do that, we need to introduce the notion of [rdfs:domain](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#domain) and [rdfs:range](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#range). Basically, these two specify the class of the things connected by a property: the [rdfs:domain](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#domain) it the class of the thing the property is about, and the [rdfs:range](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#range) is the class of the thing that the property points to. Therefore, we can add to our vocabulary:
```
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

obelisk:Obelisk rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Person rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Sculptor rdf:type rdfs:Class .

obelisk:ownedBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
obelisk:ownedBy rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk .
obelisk:ownedBy rdfs:range obelisk:Person .

obelisk:builtBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
obelisk:builtBy rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk .
obelisk:builtBy rdfs:range obelisk:Sculptor .

obelisk:height rdf:type owl:DataProperty .
obelisk:height rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk .
obelisk:height rdfs:range xsd:float .
```

Here, we could point out that things are getting very verbose. Hopefully, the Turtle syntax allows to make things shorter by not repeating the thing that we talk about when adding multiple properties to it (e.g. `obelisk:ownedBy` in the next snippet):
```
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

obelisk:Obelisk rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Person rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Sculptor rdf:type rdfs:Class .

obelisk:ownedBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    # We removed the repetitions of obelisk:ownedBy, and replaced the end of line by ; instead of .
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range obelisk:Person .

obelisk:builtBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    # here too
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range obelisk:Sculptor .

obelisk:height rdf:type owl:DataProperty ;
    # and there as well
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range xsd:float .
```

### Connecting to other vocabularies

Terms in vocabularies are identified by IRI, and it's not for decoration: it means that you can use the identifiers accross the whole Web. The cool thing about it is that it makes it really easy to reuse terms from remote vocabularies into your own. For instance, `obelisk:Obelisk` is quite a specific term, so it makes perfect sense to define it ourselves. What about `obelisk:Person` ? Maybe there is a reference vocabulary out there that defines the concept of person... And if you pay a quick visit to [our list of well-known vocabularies](1-well-known), you will see that there is! For instance, [Friend of a Friend](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/) (foaf for short) defines the term [foaf:Person](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person), and it would make our vocabulary easier to integrate into any application if we just reused this term instead of defining our own. Therefore, our vocabulary could look more something like this:

```
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

obelisk:Obelisk rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Sculptor rdf:type rdfs:Class .

obelisk:ownedBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    # Now using the foaf:Person class
    rdfs:range foaf:Person .

obelisk:builtBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range obelisk:Sculptor .

obelisk:height rdf:type owl:DataProperty ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range xsd:float .
```

Moreover, let's say it: sculptors are persons too! Therefore, the class we define and that is specific to our vocabulary is a specialization of a class defined elsewhere. Saying so is actually very easy, with the [rdfs:subClassOf](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf) property:
```
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

obelisk:Obelisk rdf:type rdfs:Class .
obelisk:Sculptor rdf:type rdfs:Class ;
    # We say that a obelisk:Sculptor is a specific type of foaf:Person
    rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person.

obelisk:ownedBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range foaf:Person .

obelisk:builtBy rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range obelisk:Sculptor .

obelisk:height rdf:type owl:DataProperty ;
    rdfs:domain obelisk:Obelisk ;
    rdfs:range xsd:float .
```
