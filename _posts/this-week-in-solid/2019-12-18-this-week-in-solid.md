# This Year in Solid 2019

Hello and welcome to another edition of This Week in Solid!

[Solid](https://solidproject.org) is a standard that describes how to build data storage and applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.

This is the last edition of 2019 so here's a recap of This Year in Solid to look at the highlights of the year. 

The main activities happening within Solid GitHub are: governance, awareness, standardisation as well as implementation and tooling which is happening both in the Solid Github as well as in other locations. Let's go through each of these activities one by one. 

### A record of who is working on what, where 
At the start of the year newcomers were not sure how to contribute to Solid. Over the year we have worked on recording who works on what and where so that new comers know how to support others and when to start new projects. 

### The Solid properties have been collected and maintained by the Administrators 

### The test suite is in development 

### solidproject.org is live 
At the start of the year information about Solid was dispersed over various location, by different people, sometimes duplicated. Over the year we have come together to collect the information about Solid in a single repository (which was called 'Information'). This was the base content used to build solidproject.org which was put together with a lot of hard work from the Creators. 

### the mailing list was set up 
This Week in Solid has been set up as a touch point to easily stay in the loop and share information with each other. 

### Solid Events 
Over 2019 we had 25 Solid Events in 18 locations in the USA, Europe, and Beijing. Thank you to all the hard work by the event organisers for making this happen. 

### Public Speaking 
63 talks mentioning Solid 

### Articles 
There were more than 150 articles mentioning Solid across 2019. 

### Weekly recurring and well attended calls on specific themes to develop Solid 

### Clear destination repo for Solid 
At the start of the year Solid was being worked on in several different respositories asynchronously. Now, there is a clear agreed destination where to put the final result. 

### Defined milestones of work to work on Solid 

### Tooling 
* [triple doc](https://vincenttunru.gitlab.io/tripledoc/)
* [Exploration of client-side RDF libraries](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-lib-comparison)

### Implementations 

## Wishlist for 2020 
Here's a little list of things that people have mentioned they would love to see happen in 2020: 
* Consistent coherent description of what Solid is 
* Stable standard
* Improved onboarding 
* User friendly apps 
* Multiple Pod implementations
* Better developing tools

Until next year :)
