Now that we have a vocabulary, let's use it to describe some real obelisk data! To this end, let us introduce the two most renowned obelisk sculptors of all time: [Vuittonluis](https://vuittonluis.solid.community/profile/card#me) and [G. Armani](https://garmani.solid.community/profile/card#me). If you look up their profiles, you'll notice that each of them describes himself as an [`obelisk:Sculptor`](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Sculptor):
```turtle
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
# The next line defines an empty prefix ":", which points to the current document (e.g. https://garmani.solid.community/profile/card)
@prefix : <#>.

# "a" is the standard shorthand for "rdf:type".
:me a obelisk:Sculptor.

#...
```

Describing data uses the same syntax as building a vocabulary: the thing that we are talking about is [`:me`](https://garmani.solid.community/profile/card#me), and we are saying that this thing is of [rdf:type](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type) [`obelisk:Sculptor`](http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/Sculptor).  

Let's create the first obelisk of your collection in your own Pod. You can see the obelisk described in RDF in the file `src/collection.js`:
```turtle
@prefix : <#>.
@prefix obelisk: <http://w3id.org/obelisk/ns/> .
@prefix me: <http://your.webid> .

:myFirstObelisk a obelisk:Obelisk ;
    obelisk:ownedBy me: ;
    obelisk:heigth "15.0" .
```

However, it's not really convenient to manage vocabularies as plain text: it is error-prone, hard to maintain, and unpleasant to read. To address this issue, we provide a [quickstart guide to using your vocabulary in code](5-1-quickstart-artifacts).
