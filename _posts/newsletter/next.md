## Updates

### [Events](https://solidproject.org/events)

Solid World is an opportunity to meet people who are interested in or currently working on Solid.

A big thank you to Christian Buggedei, Walter Almeida, Glen Simister, Manoharan Ramachandran, and Michiel de Jong for presenting at Solid World May last Thursday.

In the first talk, Christian Buggedei presented Darcy, a social network that knows nothing about you.Of note, Darcy recently won a Mozilla grant. You can find the Darcy source code here. Christian Buggedei is a founder and technology expert.

In the second talk, Walter Almeida presented GO for modeling and generating Solid apps quickly with minimum code. He demonstrated the GO connector between Pod and Sparql endpoints using a location tracking Solid app that leverages dbPedia.org as a data source for countries and places. You can find the Go location app source code here.

In the third talk, Manoharan Ramachandran presented the Solid app built by Open University's blockchain team, looking into how to support immunity passports as mentioned by the UK government daily briefings. The Solid app facilitates the instant verification of tamper-proof test results whilst preserving privacy.

In the fourth talk, Glen Simister presented the DVO Profile Manager, a public profile (or resume), which anyone can create for free, and update. DVO Profile Manager works in conjunction with the DVO Toolbar, a browser extension which allows people to like, dislike, and comment on any URL. You can find the DVO Profile Manager source code here.

In the fifth talk, Michiel de Jong presented his latest experiment, SNAP on Solid, explaining how Solid inboxes can be used as the messaging layer for Network Ledger Technology. Check out the SNAP source code here.
