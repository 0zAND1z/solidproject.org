Hello and welcome to another edition of This Week in Solid!

[Solid](https://solidproject.org) is a set of open specifications, built on existing open standards, that describes how to build applications in such a way that users can conveniently switch between data storage providers and application providers and take the data generated along.

This is a weekly summary of Solid progress.

Want something mentioned? Contact the Solid Manager at info@solidproject.org. This Week in Solid is openly developed [on GitHub](http://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/blob/master/_posts/newsletter/next.md). If you find any errors in this week's issue please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/pulls).

Want to get involved? [Contributions are welcome.](https://solidproject.org/standardisation)

Every Thursday there is an hour-long public call where newcomers can introduce themselves, anyone can ask general questions about Solid, and we recap the weeks' works on Solid.
